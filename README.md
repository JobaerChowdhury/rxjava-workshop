# A workshop to learn about RxJava 
The workshop is divided into 3 days. Each session we'll solve some problem using RxJava. 
## Day 1
At first we will learn the basics of creating Observables. Then we'll do some transformation using map and filter. We'll
also do some basic composition using flatMap and zip. 
## Day 2
We'll learn more about asynchronous programming using RxJava. 
## Day 3
We'll experiment with web server request/response model. And try to see how reactive way can help us improve performance.
